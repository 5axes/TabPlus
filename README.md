# Tab Anti Warping +
Add element as rounded Tab to limit warping effect in print corner. This plugin is an improved version of my first plugin : [TabAntiWarping](https://github.com/5axes/TabAntiWarping).


![Pastille](./images/pastille_anti_wrapping.jpg)

Using Helper Disks, which act on the corners of your model to help keep everything pinned down. Once the print is finished, the disks can be cut away pretty easily.


**Note : Actual solution is limited by the possibility to use just a global : Support X/Y Distance**

The automatic functions of adding and deleting tabs make it easy to create each elements.

This new design has been integrated following the request of [Reality4DEvolution](https://github.com/Reality4DEvolution) in this post : [Discussion #9](https://github.com/5axes/TabAntiWarping/discussions/9)

The new design should offer a bevel on the outsite of the tab to be much more easy to remove, as you can get the scraper under it, and start to remove the project much easier.
