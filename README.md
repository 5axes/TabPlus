Using Helper Disks, which act on the corners of your model to help keep everything pinned down. Once the print is finished, the disks can be cut away pretty easily.

Test with a diameter of 20mm and Support X/Y Distance=0.2mm. To keep a support with a full pattern don't goes over 20/25mm.

This new design has been integrated following the request of [Reality4DEvolution](https://github.com/Reality4DEvolution) in this post : [Discussion #9](https://github.com/5axes/TabAntiWarping/discussions/9) 

![Capsule design](./images/capsule.png)

The new design should offer a bevel on the outsite of the tab to be much more easy to remove, as you can get the scraper under it, and start to remove the project much easier.
